 "x "How long has it been since you had to walk for such a long time?

 "x "s "Sigh... Are we there yet?

 "x "It's been over 40 minutes since we started walking from the station.

 "x "s "... I'm tired.

 "x "Which makes that the umpteenth time Sora has grumbled those words.

 "x "h "I know its hard. It's been a long time since you've walked this far. Just hang in there. We're almost there.

 "x "s "You said that already.

 "x "Well, if you're only going to repeat yourself, I can only repeat myself back.

 "x "h "We've walked further than before... So we really are closer.

 "x "s "Uuuh... That doesn't answer my question.

 "x "Judging from that weak voice barely leaking out of her, it's clear that she isn't acting.

 "x "Although we rested every now and then, this was still probably very hard on her feet. She didn't have much stamina to begin with...

 "x "h "At any rate, this is some nice weather we're having...
 
 "x "It seems the more enthusiasm I put into my voice, the more it feels like the sky has grown further than when I was on the train. No matter where I look, I am surrounded by its piercing blue.

 "x "At least the air was as clean as the sky was clear... This place feels refreshing ─ and it's not a humid heat. Thanks to that, we're walking without sweating much.

 "x "If we were having the same muggy air we have in the city, we'd be sweating buckets by now. There's no doubt that even I'd be whining.

 "x "h "Here, I'll push you from behind. Just hang in there.

 "x "As I tried to reach for Sora's back, she quickly dodged.

 "x "s "Stop that... It's embarrassing...

 "x "h "It's not like anyone's looking... If you don't like it, then just walk and bear with it.

 "x "Just as we tried to continue.

 "x "s "Huh?! KYAH~!

 "x "h "Huh? What's up?

 "x "Gripping the sleeve of my shirt, Sora hid behind my back.

 "x "s "Something just jumped out from the bushes over there!

 "x "h "Eh?

 "x "Just as she said that, a big, green insect hopped out.

 "x "s "Wah~?!

 "x "h "Ahahaha! It's just a grasshopper.

 "x "Two or three more appeared ─ hopping along after the first.

 "x "s "Uuu~... Get away!

 "x "h "Ah. Hey, hey! Wait up!

 "x "Sora tried to get away as fast as she could.

 "x "h "Hahaha. Now that I think about it. Grasshoppers used to freak you out back then too didn't they?

 "x "s "S-Shut up! Stop laughing!

 "x "h "Sorry, sorry. Anyway, let's get out of here.

 "x "Sora stepped up her pace as if being chased by the grasshoppers. Thanks to that we were able to arrive at our destination faster than I thought.

 "x "Hooray for grasshoppers... I guess?
